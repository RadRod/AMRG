Remember that this tool is still in beta, so there may still be a bug or 2!

Description:

This tool gives the user the ability to create a romlist from favorites tagged via Attract Mode, or by
specifying custom search criteria. This tool can be useful for helping to create collections romlists etc.
This was written as part of Hyperpie V2.

Key features:

- Create a romlist from tagged favorites
- Create a romlist based on user specified search criteria. Any number of strings can be specified (seperate each with comma).
- Ability to search in specific rom information, such as rom name, title, year, or manufacturer.

Misc features:

- Automatically prevents duplicates from being added to output romlist
- User definable romlist path, output directory and filename
- Quick tag search (only searches romlist files that have an accomodating .tag file)

For any questions/comments or to report a bug, please contact me on the Hyperpie FB group (or the forums).
